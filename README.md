### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `fs-react-shopping`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Open two terminal windows
5. Run `npm run server` in your first terminal window
6. Run `npm run client` in your second terminal window
7. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
