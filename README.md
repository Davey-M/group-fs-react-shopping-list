## Description

_Duration: 4 hours_

This app was created as a solution for tracking purchases. It allows the user to input items with a name, quantity, and unit of measurement, making storing past purchases a breeze.

## Screen Shot

Include one or two screen shots of your project here (optional). Remove if unused.

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `fs-react-shopping`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Open two terminal windows
5. Run `npm run server` in your first terminal window
6. Run `npm run client` in your second terminal window
7. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

1. Track grocery or other purchases.
2. Store past purchases to easily find later.
3. Keep track of future purchasing needs.
